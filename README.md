# gps-attendance-tracker
I have created an attendance tracker using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, featuring a user-friendly interface for marking and viewing attendance records. The tracker utilizes JavaScript for dynamic functionality, such as real-time updates, form validation, and interactive UI elements. It provides a structured layout for students and teachers to efficiently manage attendance, ensuring accuracy and ease of use.
